ill give you the idea i want to build first of all what i want is just an mvp so the idea is a networking app for conferences, meetups, and professional events that helps attendees discover relevant people nearby using proximity tech, live maps, and interest-matching algorithms.

1. User Registration & Profiles

Sign-Up Flow:
Users register with name, job title, company, and expertise (e.g., "AI Engineer," "Startup Founder").
Tags for interests (e.g., "Quantum Computing," "Sustainability").
Optional: LinkedIn/GitHub integration, profile photo.
Privacy Settings:
Toggle visibility: "Show my name," "Show only my expertise," "Go anonymous."
Opt-in to share location continuously, only when app is open, or never.


so we want it as a mobile app with react native and expo but since this is just an mvp you create it as a website responsive the just for demo with fake data just showing the prosess 

so build a modern and clean website responsive
it will be static since this is just an mvp so we just want something to pitch
